## How to compile and install

To run the project, do the following:

    1. create a folder where you want to store the files of the server.
    2. Open **server.py** and update the directory of **root** to where the folder is
    3. configure the ips of the other two servers in **server_to_connect** 
    4. Run file server in a separate directory - **python3 server.py**
    5. if you are running the server and client on the same machine then keep the folders separate for client and for server
    6. Open **client.py** and update the directory of root to where the client folder is
    7. Run client in a separate directory - **python3 client.py**
